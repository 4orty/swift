Notes on Go Swift
=================

Headers should be set and returned in HTTP canonical

Rename to go-swift to match user agent string

Reconnect on auth error - 403 when token expires

Implement read all files / containers which uses limit and marker to loop

Make more api compatible with python cloudfiles?

Timeout?

Retry operations on timeout / network errors?

Put USER_AGENT and RETRIES into Connection

Make Connection thread safe - whenever it is changed take a write lock whenever it is read from a read lock

Add extra headers field to Connection (for via etc)

Could potentially store response in Connection but would make it thread unsafe

Make errors use an error heirachy then can catch them with a type assertion

 Error(...)
 ObjectCorrupted{ Error }

Make a Debug flag for logging stuff

Object If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since etc

Object range

Object create, update with X-Delete-At or X-Delete-After

Large object support
- check uploads are less than 5GB in normal mode?

Access control CORS?

Copy object

Swift client retries and backs off for all types of errors

Write a script which uses this and replicates the functionality of swift tool
