Notes on Go Swift
=================

Make a container struct so these could be methods on it?

Make noResponse check for 204?

Make storage public so it can be extended easily?

Rename to go-swift to match user agent string?

Reconnect on auth error - 401 when token expires isn't tested

Make more api compatible with python cloudfiles?

Retry operations on timeout / network errors?
- also 408 error

Make Connection thread safe - whenever it is changed take a write lock whenever it is read from a read lock

Add extra headers field to Connection (for via etc)

Make errors use an error heirachy then can catch them with a type assertion

 Error(...)
 ObjectCorrupted{ Error }

Make a Debug flag in connection for logging stuff

Object If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since etc

Object range

Object create, update with X-Delete-At or X-Delete-After

Large object support
- check uploads are less than 5GB in normal mode?

Access control CORS?

Swift client retries and backs off for all types of errors

Make Timeout work as well as ConnectionTimeout
